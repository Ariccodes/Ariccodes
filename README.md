- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ariccodes
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of pointless stuff such as chess, rubik's cube, acoustic guitars, song writing and a lot of other things that have nothing to do with computers. (guess I'm in the wrong line) 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript & C. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: You know the L'Hospitals rule? Yeah it's not actually L'Hospital it's L'hopital (pronounced as loo-pee-tal). It's shocking as to how such as essential rule in calculus is written incorrectly in such global scale. How'd you feel if i terribly pronounced your name? By the way,another fun fact :you definitely don't need that knowledge and you just wasted your precious 2 minutes im reading that.
